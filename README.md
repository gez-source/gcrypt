# gcrypt

Gcrypt cryptographic (not) hash function.

There is a need in both the legal and forensics spaces for a program that can verify the integrity of files quicker than other products on the market. 
People in forensics need to be able to preserve the chain of custody for investigations, 
lawyers need to be able to find and retrieve legal documents quickly, 
and blockchain developers are looking for a cleaner alternative to current blockchain methods of block hashing. 

Antivirus companies are in need of newer signature generation tools that are both fast at hashing large files and memory-efficient but that donâ€™t compromise on security.
Both the cryptographic and non-cryptographic hash methods become obsolete since attackers and security professionals find weaknesses in them. 
There is always a market for a new algorithm. 

This algorithm does not try and achieve these bold ideas but serves as a point of reference that can be analysed and made better as time goes on.


There exist identical versions, one written in python, another much faster version written in C++, a C language version, and a C# version.
